I am making this text document outside of unity since it keeps crashing whenever i use it right now. 


To load into the game you would normaly use the Menu scene, but mine does not function correcly so loading up 
the first level is the only way to acces the Level.

We used the Cinemaschine,NewInputSystem and also Eflatun Packages.


I do have only the features we have build in class, and those not even fully and not all working. 
Fully Functional really only is the enemy: With the "lineOfSigntCheck"(i know i had spelled it wrong there ;-;
"SimpleEnemyBehaviour" Working well and the enemy is able to do everything they need to do. 

But i was not able to make the player walk at any point, and i wasnt able to add a cript that takes care of the movement
why? because i got to confused and the script did not make sense. I would need to start with the script to know a bit better what i am doing. 

The UI also is not functional since i was not able to keep up in class and not able to finish it on my own, which sadly mainly came from the amount of deadlines we had now.
I was working on a diffrent deadline each day. And once i did touch the script i managed to delet more. 

I have also only know realized i have never actually Commited anything i did untill now (18.06 ~22:50)
I have always staged the things and clicked "push"thinking that was the right thing to do. 

I am terribly sorry for this mess of a project, I hope to have something that moves at out game jam. 

I belive my unity somehow is messed up, but that wouldnt be the first time a program completly died on me.
